### Problem Statement: To check raising towers in matrix
In this problem, we will be given a no. of towers with some values in it. If the value is increasing level by level then the tower is rising.
Otherwise the tower is not rising. 
To check if the tower is rising, we check the tower in an algorithm which checks the tower from first floor and checks the value of each floor.
The main challenge I faced was to print the towers vertically. 
There are two scenerios- one where the tower values are randomly generated and other where the user input the values.
